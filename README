Package::Transporter - a modular and OO-aware interface to AUTOLOAD

This is an experimental module and in relation to its complexity there
are not enough tests available to consider it ready for general
production use, yet.

Package::Transporter can be seen as a class for AUTOLOAD objects, which
are managed behind a system of convenience methods. The objects
provide potential instead of drain. The potential can be tested with
two functions, potentially_can and potentially_defined.  For details,
read the man page for Package::Transporter.

You might want to run the examples from the directory of the same name.
