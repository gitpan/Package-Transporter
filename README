Transporter - encourages the use of constant functions

Through convenient management of constant functions a 
a greater expressiveness of Perl5 code can be achieved,
while keeping fundamental programming practices intact.
Constant functions result in an inlined value, meaning that
no actual subroutine call is performed by perl internally.

Transporter generates Perl code based on very simple rules defined by
the programmer. The generated code is added to modules via an
explicitly declared visit point. Transporter won't do magic
(something implicit in the background) via arbitrary symbol table
manipulations.
