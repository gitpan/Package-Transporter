Package::Transporter - Export, Import, AUTOLOAD, and OO meet

This is an experimental module and in relation to its complexity there
are not enough tests available to consider it ready for general
production use, yet.

Package::Transporter is about automated loading and distribution of
subroutines. Subroutines can be loaded from various origins and in
various forms. For example as text from a SQL database or more
conventionally as references from another package. If a subroutine is
immediately implemented during distribution, that is called drain. If
a subroutine is implemented on demand, that is called potential.

You might want to run the examples from the directory of the same name.
