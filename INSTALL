Installation only makes sense to follow the development. Although it
appears that the interfaces finally settle, anything might
change. Don't expect support for versions other than the current. 

For versions of Perl before 5.10, install MRO::Compat first and enable it
by editing the file lib/Package/Transporter/Package.pm.

Other than that, Package::Transporter is fairly straightforward in terms of
installation. 

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Package::Transporter makes use of the follwoing external modules, most
of which are part of the Perl5 core.

	Scalar::Util
	mro
	parent
	Carp
	Test::Simple (for installation)

The example files and some generators require these additional modules:

	Data::Dumper
	Fcntl
	SDBM_File
	DBI (not in the core, but widely found)
