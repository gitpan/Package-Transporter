Installation only makes sense to follow the development. Anything might
change. Don't expect support for versions other than the current. 

For versions of Perl before 5.10, install MRO::Compat first and enable it
by editing the file lib/Package/Transporter/Package.pm.

Other than that, Package::Transporter is fairly straightforward in terms of
installation. 

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Package::Transporter makes use of the follwoing modules, most
of which are part of the Perl5 core.

	Scalar::Util
	mro
	parent
	Carp
	Test::Simple (for installation)

The example files and some generators require these additional modules:

	Data::Dumper
	Fcntl
	SDBM_File
	DBI (not in the core, but widely found)
